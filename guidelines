Library used is Celestial Library Database.Naming convention is same as used there.

1.Component naming convention : 
    a)Passives
        Footprint name: 
        Capacitors : Capacitor <package size (imperial)>/<package size (metric)>
        eg: CAP 0603/1608
        
        Resistors : Resistor <package size (imperial)>/<package size (metric)>
        eg: RES 0603/1608
        
        Description : 
        Capacitors : Capacitor, <type>, <capacitance>, <voltage>, <temperature coefficient>, <package size (imperial)>
        eg: CAP CER 0.1UF 16V X7R 0402 
        
        Resistors : Resistor, <type>,<resistance>, <tolerance>, <rated power>, <package size (imperial)>
        eg: RES SMD 1K OHM 1% 1/10W 0402
        
2.Template altium project file : 
suggestion : try youtube videos

3.Standard folder structure for Altium files : 
>Project Name
    >Integrated Library
        >3D Models(step files)
    >Datasheets
    >Design Files
        *.SchDocs
        *.PcbDocs
    >Manufacturing
        Gerbers+NC Drill+Readme and notes to manufacturer
    PCB description.txt  

4.Standard practices : 
    Name all the important nets so that during layout yo immediately know what net you are routing. 

5.Style guide : 
    i will be listing robert ferancac's tips : 
    -create a board release procedure
    -Put a big title on the top of each page and put a small title for each chip / connector
    -Under a component with exposed pad (EP), place caps with gnd and power pins oriented
    - Add “PCB only” components into your schematic (mounting holes, fiducials, ...) set the as no BOM type
