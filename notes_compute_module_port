1.started with figuring out how to transfer a component from the celestial dblib, with all its supplier links and other parameters into my own integrated libaray. It was a really painful and slow experiment.
 Finally found out that parts search in Altium will do the trick,just drag and drop.

2.I decided to follow the guidelines and thought of adding alternate functions in each pin of stm32f401 uC instead of just PA0,PA1 etc.

3.It took me some time to figure out, but STM32CubeMX can generate the pinouts with or without alternate functions into a csv file. I opened it in google sheets and merged the coloums delimited by "," to generate the pin names with all their alternate functions. 

4.Next, using smart grid copy and schlib, I pasted them into the coloumns.(TIP : sort the list by the pin numbers b4 pasting)

5." / " is a better delimiter the "," though it takes up lot of space.
